This repo contains surface mount devices in SOD, SOT and other packages as well as some connectors I have needed for myself.
The connectors come with labels only atm, but all others are available with and without labels.

The models are oriented so that pin 1 is at the top left most times (I think the DPAK/D2PAK break this rule). The VRML models are scaled by a factor of 0.3937 to be used without scaling in KiCAD. File names are the same for STEP and VRML.

License wise those are all GPLv3+ which is commented into the STEP files - for the VRML files I haven't added that yet, but will do in due course.

If you find any errors, please send me a message here or on Github.

I'll upload footprints to those models once I have aligned them to the 3D models.
